* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to initialize and run an Arduino Uno R3 in
* order to communicate with an MCP4725 12-bit DAC breakout
*   - Write MCP4725 registers to set output voltage ratio
*		(Vout = Vin * REG/4096)
*	- Ability to write in either DAC or EEPROM mode		
*   - can also turn off the DAC, setting Vout to be pulled-down by 1k resistor
